.SH NOTES
.SS Client certificates
.PP
\fBastro\fR can work with client certificates if capsules requires them for authentication.
\fBastro\fR allows a single client certificate per (sub)domain identified by it's name. If a client cert for a specific domain is available astro will send it to the server with every request.
When a resource requires a client cert and astro can't find one it will show you a command to create a client cert for the capsule.
The certificates are stored in \fI$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/astro/certs/\fR.
.PP
To remove a certificate simply delete the \fI<domain>.crt\fR and \fI<domain>.key\fR files in the directory mentioned above.
.SH CONFIGURATION
You can setup a config file at \fI$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/astro/astro.conf\fR to configure \fBastro\fR the way you like.
The file uses a simple \fBkey=value\fR style, see the complete example for the default values below.
